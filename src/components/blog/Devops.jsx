              Canary releases and canary changes are: In the world of software
              development and IT operations, the traditional siloed approach
              often hinders efficiency, productivity, and collaboration.
              However, with the emergence of DevOps and Site Reliability
              Engineering (SRE) practices, organizations are embracing a new way
              of working that breaks down these barriers. In this blog post, we
              will explore how DevOps, collaboration, SRE practices, and shared
              ownership contribute to more effective and streamlined software
              delivery processes.

        </h3>
        <p className="text-base">
          DevOps is a cultural and organizational shift that emphasizes
          collaboration, communication, and integration between development
          (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. Here's how DevOps breaks down silos
          and fosters collaboration.

          Collaboration is a cornerstone of successful software delivery. It
          involves open communication, knowledge sharing, and joint
          problem-solving. Here are some key aspects of collaboration in the
          context of breaking down silos:

          Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices provide a framework for
          achieving reliable and scalable systems. SRE emphasizes collaboration,
          automation, and measurement. Here's how SRE practices contribute to
